I thought hapi was ehhhh... It had pretty good 
docs overall however and was super similar to express. 
Where I felt it lacked was how much code I
had to type just to get the same thing in express. 
Overall I give hapi a 6 where express is a 10. 
I tried using Koa at first but it was hard to find documentation 
on the forums and website on how to use it.
